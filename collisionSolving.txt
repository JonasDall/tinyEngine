Collisions and constraints are components
COllisions deal with all physics related
All collisions have:
SetPosition (from component)
AddPosition (from component)
and AddForce

Only rigidbodies react to AddForce

In order for a rigidbody to be connected to another object, a constraint has to be put in use. A constraint can be locked to an axis as well.
